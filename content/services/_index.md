# Our Approach
Our theory of change is that we will have the most impact by enabling you to achieve your mission. We want to build the community of those engaged in good work. We want to enable you to solve the problems you are most passionate about whether that is a sustainable environment, community development, or healthy toddlers. Rather than focus on a single problem, our strategy is to enable as many people and groups as possible.



We focus on collaboration. We want to work with you, not just for you. We
manage projects step by step, with attention to detail, while keeping an
eye on the big picture. We strive for clear milestones and big outcomes.


- We have a deep bench. No matter what the project, we can bring the necessary expertise needed. We draw from our many friends at WSU and UI and our extensive network of experts with whom we have collaborated.
- We focus on collaboration. We want to work with you, not just for you.
- We can collect data, conduct interviews, focus groups, and surveys, and develop writing of all types in both English and Spanish.
