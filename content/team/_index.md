Saulgill Consulting brings together a multidisciplinary team of individuals with many years of experience carrying out research, outreach, and education projects. We have collaborated with diverse partners, including nonprofit groups, Native American tribes, health clinics and hospitals, colleges and universities, government agencies, and K-12 schools.

No matter what the project, we can bring the necessary expertise needed. We’ve worked at universities, nonprofit organizations, and private companies. We’ve worked with health professionals, educators, environmental groups, tribes, and agencies. We recruit and collaborate regularly with those with a wide diversity of expertise and experience.
